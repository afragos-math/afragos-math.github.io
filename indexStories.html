                <b>1.</b> Some aliens decend from A of Centaurus and give to mathematicians, physicists and statiscticians three rods. They say: "If each one of you paints a segment of irrational length on these rods, we will spare humanity and earth. Otherwise, prepare for your doom". Mathematicians start to calculate Dedekind cuts and arrive to an irrational number. Physicists examine the half-life of the rod, do some integrals and take e back. Staticticians say: "The probability of choosing a rational number at random is 0", so they paint a line without calculating, of length 21/35.

                <b>3.</b> A statistician wants to go to a conference, but the only mean of transport is a plane and he is afraid of terrorists. He sits and calculates the probability of a bomb existing in the plane and finds it is quite high. However, the probability of two bombs in the same plane is small, so he takes a bomb and goes to his flight.

He trows all of the them out and now on my plate remains only one. How should I watch my diet this way? Another set-theorist friend comes in, cuts the pea, rotates the pieces and reassembles a huge pea.

                    Coxeter came to Cambridge and he gave a lecture, then he had this problem for which he gave proofs for selected examples, and he asked for a unified proof. I left the lecture room thinking. As I was walking through Cambridge, suddenly the idea hit me, but it hit me while I was in the middle of the road. When the idea hit me I stopped and a large truck ran into me and bruised me considerably, and the man considerably swore at me. So I pretended that Coxeter had calculated the difficulty of this problem so precisely that he knew that I would get the solution just in the middle of the road. In fact. I limped back after the accident to the meeting. Coxeter was still there, and I said, "You nearly killed me." Then I told him the solution. It eventually became a joint paper. Ever since, I've called that theorem "the murder weapon." One consequence of it is that in a group if \(a^2=b^3=c^5=(abc)^{-1}\), then \(c^{610}=1\).

                    There once was a mathematician in Greece after junta who wanted to continue his studies in Princeton. He filed an application, but a problem was that instead of translating "Βραβείο ηρώων Πολυτεχνίου" to "Award for the heroes of Polytechnion" in his CV, he instead opted for "Rebels award". The examination commitee was very sceptical in Princeton, thinking of denying his application because of it, despite displaying great mathematical capabilities. Dafermos found one of the mathematicians of the commitee and explained what the award really was. The mathematician said that he would transfer this to their meeting, so Dafermos waited outside eagerly. After some time the mathematician walks out and Dafermos asks what happened. He replies something of the form: "You cannot imagine what happened! I haven't eaten all morning and when I go in, they have prepared food for us. I go in, I grab some coffee and a sandwich. The coffee was ok, but the sandwich... The sandwich was the worst sandwich I have ever eaten, absolutely horrendous. I don't think you have ever eaten a sandwich like this before Mihali". Dafermos asks what happened with the application. He replies: "Oh, I don't know, I didn't say anything, the sandwich was so bad that I immediately left". In the end they rejected the application.

                    Now, lots of you probably thought that 91 was prime. Well, in fact you are near the truth. 91 is actually the first number that looks prime but isn't. So, this is a rotten theorem and a discovery that I'm very proud of and I'll give you the proof of it. You see, if a number is divisible by 2, 3 or 5 it doesn't even look prime. Okay, so 91 at least evades that test. It follows if the number looks like a prime but isn't, it must be made out of sevens and elevens and thirteens and higher. Seven 7s are 49 and that looks square and we know this isn't prime. Then seven 11s is 77 and that doesn't look prime. But seven 13s is 91, end of the proof.

                    Of course in a vector space you can have a (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Hamel">Hamel</a>) basis and therefore represent any element as a finite combination of the basis elements (possibly uncountable basis). For doing analysis another kind of basis is preferable, that is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliusz_Schauder">Schauder</a> basis, where it is possible to write every element as an infinite series involving the basis elements (always countable "basis", by definition).
                    $$x = {\lim_{n \to \infty}}^{||\cdot||} \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k e_k = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \lambda_k e_k$$
                    This infinity requires an added stucture to our vector space that can express convergence, that is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach">Banach</a> space structure. It is not difficult to prove that every Banach space with Schauder basis is seperable, however the converse was something that gave headaches to the mathematicians of the era. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_Enflo">Per Enflo</a> in 1972 managed to construct a seperable Banach space without a Schauder basis, thus disproving the converse. Earlier, actually a lot earlier, in 1936, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Mazur">Mazur</a> had written about a similar problem on the Scottish Book, promising a live goose reward to whoever managed to find a solution. Even after 36 years, Mazur kept his promise and awarded a live goose to Per Enflo for his achievement, in a ceremony held at Stefan Banach Center. The ceremony was broadcast thoughout Poland. A picture can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MazurGes.jpg">here</a>.
