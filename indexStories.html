                <b>1.</b> Some aliens decend from A of Centaurus and give to mathematicians, physicists and statiscticians three rods. They say: "If each one of you paints a segment of irrational length on these rods, we will spare humanity and earth. Otherwise, prepare for your doom". Mathematicians start to calculate Dedekind cuts and arrive to an irrational number. Physicists examine the half-life of the rod, do some integrals and take e back. Staticticians say: "The probability of choosing a rational number at random is 0", so they paint a line without calculating, of length 21/35.

                <b>3.</b> A statistician wants to go to a conference, but the only mean of transport is a plane and he is afraid of terrorists. He sits and calculates the probability of a bomb existing in the plane and finds it is quite high. However, the probability of two bombs in the same plane is small, so he takes a bomb and goes to his flight.

                <b>4.</b> I have prepared peas for lunch and I am ready to eat. My algebraist friend walks in and says that the ammount of peas is unnessesary, as all are homeomorphic to each other. He trows all of the them out and now on my plate remains only one. How should I watch my diet this way? Another set-theorist friend comes in, cuts the pea, rotates the pieces and reassembles a huge pea.

The poet argues that it's better to have a mistress because love should be free and spontaneous. The priest argues that it's better to have a wife because love should be sanctified by God. The mathematician says, "I think it's better to have both. That way, when each of them thinks you're with the other, you can do some mathematics".

Physicists have bought a ticket each, while mathematicians bought only one ticket for the whole group. When the train departs, mathematicians go to the bathroom together. The conductor knocks, they crack the door open and provide a ticket. The conductor assumes that there is only one person inside and leaves. On the way back from the conference physicists buy one ticket, while mathematicians buy none. Physicists go to the bathroom together, wait for the knock and provide their ticket. Mathematicians knock, grab the ticket and run to the bathroom in the next car.

                <b>1. The Murder Weapon</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The following is by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">J. H. Conway</a>:

                    Coxeter came to Cambridge and he gave a lecture, then he had this problem for which he gave proofs for selected examples, and he asked for a unified proof. I left the lecture room thinking. As I was walking through Cambridge, suddenly the idea hit me, but it hit me while I was in the middle of the road. When the idea hit me I stopped and a large truck ran into me and bruised me considerably, and the man considerably swore at me. So I pretended that Coxeter had calculated the difficulty of this problem so precisely that he knew that I would get the solution just in the middle of the road. In fact. I limped back after the accident to the meeting. Coxeter was still there, and I said, "You nearly killed me." Then I told him the solution. It eventually became a joint paper. Ever since, I've called that theorem "the murder weapon." One consequence of it is that in a group if \(a^2=b^3=c^5=(abc)^{-1}\), then \(c^{610}=1\).
