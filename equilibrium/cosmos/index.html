                For some, magic is like a fairy tale; you have 
                to believe in it. For others, itâ€™s like science; 
                you have to study hard to understand it. 
                Whichever the case, magic can take one of 
                seven forms: air, earth, fire, water, light, 
                darkness, and spirit. These seven elements 
                are everywhere in this world, from gods and 
                mountains to commoners and flowers. 
                Which one do you choose? Or perhaps, will 
                your god make this choice in your place?
                <br><br> 
                The world is a vast place, composed by 
                many, many realms, each one with its own 
                gods, magical beasts, and lands to travel. In 
                fact, Humans, Elves, and Dwarves, all come 
                from different realms. There are 8 known 
                realms that compose the Equilibrium.
